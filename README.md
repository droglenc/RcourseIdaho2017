## Course Description
This one-day course is for students interested in expanding their R skills to estimate basic population dynamic rate parameters. Through a sequence of short lectures, code demonstrations, and hands-on application exercises, participants will use R to construct and apply an age-length key to estimate ages of individual fish from their lengths, estimate mortality rates and compare rates among groups, fit a von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) and compare function parameters among groups, and fit several stock-recruitment functions. Depending on time, participants may also fit weight-length relationships and compare parameters among groups. Participants should be familiar with the fundamentals of R.

## Pre-Course Preparation
* Install at least version 3.4.0 of R on your laptop. Directions for a first install are [here for Windows](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallRWin.html){:target="_blank"} or [here for MacOS](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallRMac.html){:target="_blank"}. If you are using Windows and already have R installed, then [here is an easy method to upgrade](http://www.r-statistics.com/2015/06/a-step-by-step-screenshots-tutorial-for-upgrading-r-on-windows/){:target="_blank"}. [*The MacOS installation directions may be dated. Simply following the installation defaults should be fine.*]
* I use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/){:target="_blank"} to interact with R (but RStudio is not required for this course). Directions to install and prepare RStudio are [here for Windows](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallRStudioWin.html){:target="_blank"} and [here for MacOS](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallRStudioMac.html){:target="_blank"}. [*The MacOS installation directions may be dated. Simply following the installation defaults should be fine.*]
* Install the `FSA`, `FSAdata`, `AICcmodavg`, `dplyr`, `magrittr`, `minpack.lm`, and  `nlstools` packages. Directions for installing packages are [here if you plan to use RStudio](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallPackagesRStudio.html){:target="_blank"} and [here for Windows](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallPackagesRWin.html) and [here for MacOS](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallPackagesRMac.html){:target="_blank"} if you plan to use R directly. Test your package installations by seeing if [this script](InstallationTester.R) runs without error.
* Download the slides, R scripts, and data for the course ([available below](#course-materials)).
* The materials for this workshop are based on my [*Introduction to Fisheries Analysis with R*](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/){:target="_blank"} book (IFAR). This book is NOT required for the workshop. However, the book is available at a 20% discount for participants in this workshop. [Contact me](mailto:derek@derekogle.com) if you would like details about how to receive this discount.
* You may want to (re)familiarize yourself with R basics (IFAR Chapters 1-3), age-length keys (IFAR Chapter 5), estimating mortality rates (IFAR chapter 11), von Bertalanffy growth functions (IFAR Chapter 12), stock-recruitment functions (IFAR Chapter 13), and weight-length relationships (IFAR Chapter 7).
